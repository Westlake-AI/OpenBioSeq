# OpenBioSeq

**News**
* OpenBioSeq v0.1.0 is initialized.

## Introduction

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.6** or higher.

`OpenBioSeq` is an open-source supervised and self-supervised bio-sequence representation learning toolbox based on PyTorch, especially for mixup-related methods.

### What does this repo do?

Learning useful bio-sequence representation efficiently facilitates various downstream tasks in biological and chemical fields. This repo focuses on supervised and self-supervised bio-sequence representation learning and is named `OpenBioSeq`.

### Major features

This repo will be continued to update in the next two months! Please watch us for latest update!

## Change Log

Please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for details and release history.

[2020-05-24] `OpenBioSeq` v0.1.0 is released.

## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for installation and dataset preparation.

## Get Started

Please see [Getting Started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for the basic usage of OpenMixup (based on MMSelfSup).
